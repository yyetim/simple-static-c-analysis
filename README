These are simple scripts (may not always be 100% robust) to do some basic C
code analysis. They require parsec and possibly regex-posix.

FunctionPrototypes
===================
A parser to print out the function prototypes in a c file so that you can put
them in a .h file

To run:
runghc FunctionPrototypes.hs < input_file.c

Considers: comments

SwitchCaseChecker
===================
A parser to print out the "case" and "default" statements that --do not-- have
break statements at the end for a given C code.

To run:
runghc SwitchCaseChecker.hs < input_file.c

Considers: break statements that break a while/for loop in a case statement.
Does not consider: loops that do not have curly brackets. nested switch/case
statements
